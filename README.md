# How to add/edit quotes
This project uses a SQLite database that is stored locally on your mobile device.
So whenever quotes are added/changed in an updated version of the app, the user needs
to reinstall the app to see those changes.

in order to **change** quotes, you can add or delete lines under app/src/main/res/raw/quotes.txt
